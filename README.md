## Hardware

## VPS

- Because I don't have public IP address at home, I am using VPS with public IP address
- Alternative would be cloudflare tunnel (which works fine in most cases), but as long as it has some limitations and it is third party service I prefer to use VPS
- Best provider in Czech is [Hukot.net](https://www.hukot.net) for 140 Kƒç/month with unlimited traffic, 4 GB RAM, 40 GB SSD and 2 CPU Core.
- For connection between my homelab and VPS I am using Tailscale

## Hypervisor

## Containers
